Subject: [PATCH] block/io: Update BSC only if want_zero is true

We update the block-status cache whenever we get new information from a
bdrv_co_block_status() call to the block driver.  However, if we have
passed want_zero=false to that call, it may flag areas containing zeroes
as data, and so we would update the block-status cache with wrong
information.

Therefore, we should not update the cache with want_zero=false.
