Subject: [PATCH] seccomp: use SIGSYS signal instead of killing the thread
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The seccomp action SCMP_ACT_KILL results in immediate termination of
the thread that made the bad system call. However, qemu being
multi-threaded, it keeps running. There is no easy way for parent
process / management layer (libvirt) to know about that situation.

Instead, the default SIGSYS handler when invoked with SCMP_ACT_TRAP
will terminate the program and core dump.

This may not be the most secure solution, but probably better than
just killing the offending thread. SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS has been
added in Linux 4.14 to improve the situation, which I propose to use
by default if available in the next patch.
