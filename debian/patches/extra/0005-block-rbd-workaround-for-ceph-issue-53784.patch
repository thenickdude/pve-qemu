Subject: [PATCH] block/rbd: workaround for ceph issue #53784

librbd had a bug until early 2022 that affected all versions of ceph that
supported fast-diff. This bug results in reporting of incorrect offsets
if the offset parameter to rbd_diff_iterate2 is not object aligned.

This patch works around this bug for pre Quincy versions of librbd.
